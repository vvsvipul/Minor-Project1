## 1. General Introduction

### 1.1 Problem Statement
The project's challenge is to showcase intelligent agents capable of learning and adapting in various gaming scenarios. It involves implementing and optimizing reinforcement learning techniques, specifically Q-learning, across different Unity games, fostering autonomous learning in agents. The multi-agent aspect in the box push scenario adds complexity, requiring agents to coordinate and learn from each other.

## 2. Overall Description
The project explores reinforcement learning techniques in C# with Unity across four distinct games:

### 2.1 1D Target Catcher (Unity Implementation of Q-Learning)
Players aim to reach a changing destination in a 3D environment. Q-learning guides decisions as the player learns to navigate efficiently in a 1D grid, showcasing the scalability of reinforcement learning techniques.

### 2.2 Box Jump (C# with Unity)
In this game, players must strategically jump to avoid obstacles. Q-learning determines optimal jumping times, showcasing adaptability in addressing dynamic decision-making scenarios.

### 2.3 Box Push (Multi-agent Scenario in C# with Unity)
Two players collaborate to push a box to a specific location. Q-tables influence decision-making, illustrating reinforcement learning's versatility in cooperative settings.

## 3. Solution Approach
The reinforcement learning algorithm employed is Q-learning, involving Q-table updates based on the learning rate, rewards, and discount factor. Each game has specific action codes and reward functions tailored to its unique dynamics.

## 4. Requirement Analysis
The project requires the development of four games in C# with Unity, incorporating reinforcement learning concepts. Functional requirements for each game detail the agent's objectives and convergence criteria.

## 5. Contributing
Contributions from fellow developers interested in reinforcement learning, game development, or both are highly encouraged. Feel free to submit pull requests, share feedback, or suggest improvements. Let's collaboratively enhance the capabilities of intelligent agents in gaming scenarios!
